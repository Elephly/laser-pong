The basic\r\nrules of pong are followed but there are some twists. Use 'w' to move your\r\npaddle up and 's' to move your paddle down. As you're playing you'll notice\r\nthat every 3 seconds or so, a black box will appear with random dimension\r\nand location. You may choose to dismiss it as unimportant, or you may\r\nobliterate it. Press the space bar to change into your gun form, but be\r\ncarful, in gun form your paddle can no longer deflect the ball; it can only\r\ndeflect the ball once it is fully transformed back into its paddle form (it\r\nwill turn black). So now that you're in your gun form, you can press 'o' to\r\nfire green lasers. These lasers do not affect the other paddle or the ball,\r\nso do not waste time trying to shoot at them. If you shoot at a black box\r\nten times, it will be destroyed. Awesome, but what do you get out of doing\r\nthat? Well, firstly, you get one point for every black box you destroy.\r\nNext, you restart the timer counting down to your death (that's right, you\r\nHAVE to destroy these boxes if you want to live). Lastly, you will get\r\neither a power shot or a nurf every time you destroy a box. If you get a\r\npower shot, you can press 'p' to release it (in gun form), but this time,\r\nyou're aiming for the other paddle. If you hit him with the yellow power\r\nshot, you will slow his speed by less than half. If you hit him with the\r\norange power shot, he will be stopped dead. Both of these effects only last\r\nfor a limited time however. Now for the nurfs, there are three possible\r\noutcomes. You may be slowed by less than half, you may be stopped dead, or\r\nyour controls may be reversed. These also only last for a couple seconds.\r\nNow that you know how to play, I should tell you exactly what the point is.\r\nAll you really want to do is last as long as you can and get as many\r\npoints as possible. Scoring on the other paddle gets you 5 points. The goal\r\nis the high score man. As a last note, you have 3 lives to start out, and\r\nobviously whenever you are scored on, you lose a live. The game ends when\r\nyou get to zero lives.\r\n\r\n### Controls\r\n| Key   | Action                              | Availability (gun / paddle / both) |\r\n| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |\r\n| w     | Move paddle up                      | both                               |\r\n| s     | Move paddle down                    | both                               |\r\n| SPACE | Transform (toggle gun/paddle state) | both                               |\r\n| o     | Fire green laser                    | gun                                |\r\n| p     | Fire power shot                     | gun                                |\r\n",
